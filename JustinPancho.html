            <p>I immigrated to Canada from the Philippines back in 2008. I've always loved tinkering and playing games on my PC. I've built computers for my friends and family as well as playing games competitively for scholarships. My other hobbies include, going to restaurants, watching shows, and reading manga. I chose to study computer science in hopes to work for my favorite companies and maybe start up my own.</p>
