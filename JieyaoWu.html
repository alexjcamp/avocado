            <p>Hi, I am Jieyao Wu. I am an international student in CST program in BCIT. 
			   I love the studying environment in BCIT, caused all the students there are working hard, 
			   which made me feel stressful and motivated. I am a little shy, and need time to adapt to a new environment, 
			   so just give me some time, hope that we can get along well then^ ^</p>
            <p>Jieyao can be reached at mwu120@my.bcit.ca</p>
