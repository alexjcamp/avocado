            <p>Hello everybody, nice to meet you all! I pretty much like anything that I can do with logical
            thinking which is why I really like programming; there's not much weirdness to it in terms of
            understanding something. I enjoy running in every season except Winter, I like reading,
            and I have a heavy addiction to memes. </p>
            <p>Remy can't be reached at linda@coldmail.ca, but rather at remtruong@live.ca</p>
