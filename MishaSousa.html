            <p>Misha has grown up in Surrey his whole life. In his spare time he likes to read and spend time with his two dogs, Rex and Matty.
			As skinny as he is, food is one of the great loves of his life. Cheese in particular, makes everything better. He is currently in 
			BCIT's CST program with hopes of graduating and becoming a software engineer. </p>
