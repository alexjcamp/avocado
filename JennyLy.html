            <p>Jenny is currently a BCIT student, but previously went to UBC. She enjoys her student status and would like to stay as a student forever if that's possible.
            Her goals in life is to graduate, get a job, get some cats and live happily ever after.

            <p>My hopes for in this program is to keep on top of my assignments, do well (get good grades) and survive. My hobbies are
                outdoor activites such as hiking, and camping during the summer. During the winter, I enjoy staying at home with a warm, hot chocolate in hand.
                There really isn't much time for hobbies anymore. Similar to most Computer Science students, we spend most of our time doing readings and our weekly assignments.
