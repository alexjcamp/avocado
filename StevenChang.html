            <p>Growing up, I had always enjoyed playing sports. I especially enjoy sports that involves speed and acceleration. I eventually went on to try everything from mountain biking, dirt biking, snowboarding to quading. I also enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, camping and motor sports. Although I have done many athletic activities, there resides a nerdy and geeky side in me. Now that I am busy, I just like to go out for a long drive when I have the time. I especially enjoy the drive up to Whistler on Sea to sky highway. My passion for cars runs deep in my vein. The sound of the engine and the smell of the burned petro makes my blood boild. So, if you love driving cars, I would love to have a conversation with you! </p>
