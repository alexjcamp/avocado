			<p>A lot of people are confused why I call myself Eugene, but my passport name is Yevhen. Here is a short explanation. In 1832 famous Russian poet Alexander Pushkin wrote a novel called “Evgeniy Onegin”. After it was officially translated into English, it Evgeniy was substituted with Eugene. Since then, Russian name Evgeniy can be officially translated as Eugene. Here comes the mind-blowing part!</p>
			<p>Since I am Ukrainian, my Russian “Evgeniy” name sounds little bit different between Ukrainian and Russian languages. Unfortunately, when Ukrainian embassy was formating my Ukrainian name into English writing, they spelled it horribly (Yevhen). For convenience reasons, I prefer to call and identify myself as Eugene, because it is easier for me, you and baristas at StarBucks! (not really, they can’t spell “Eugene” without mistakes) </p>
            <p>You can reach Eugene by:</p>
