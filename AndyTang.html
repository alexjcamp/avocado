            <p>I love programming!<br><br>The first time I felt the joy of programming was when I was building a robot to compete with my other classmates' robots in junior high school. Yes, seriously, junior high students in China build robots.<br><br>I came to Canada in 2011 and took a basic C++ course in Langara. That was my first formal training in programming.<br>In 2016, I created a database for a second car company when I was working there. That was the first time I used programming at work.<br>In 2017, I joined the CST program in BCIT. That was the first time I decided to do programming for my career.<br>Just recently, I sold a new version of database to my previous company. That was the first time I make money out of programming.<br>I hope I can have many more exciting first-times with all of you. </p>
